Room Class

  I definitely did not need a room class. My current room class made things has no useful methods. Also, since the rooms instance variable 
  in hotel system is an array of room objects, it made it harder to access the room numbers. I ended up making unnecessary methods in hotel system
  like "list_available_room_numbers" because I had to extract the room numbers from the room objects. If I had no room class and 
  simply just made the rooms instance variable in hotel system an array of integers 1 -20, I wouldn't need the extra methods.
  Also, there was no reason to list the room cost. Every room is $200 and total cost is calculated in the reservations class. 

Use of Let 

  Try to use let when you refactor hotel. Before is useful, but I feel like let could dry up your code.
